                        I am a software engineer with a current interest in Machine learning & Deep learning, I arrived here via a circuitous route.<br><br>
                         First I was a talent agent for 3 years, and then an entrepreneur for about 2 years. I am a founder or co-founder of a few companies involved in iOS Mobile development, Web development, VR and AR technologies. Since selling my company in 2015, I have devoted my energies to studying and applying software engineering and machine learning techniques.

                        My enthusiasm for machine learning (data engineering) has made me learn everything from scratch. I have learned from the best top university materials online, and have honed my skills in numerous Kaggle competitions, as well as real-world problems. I strongly believe in continuous learning as well as collaboration.

            <p>
                This was a Professional Certificate Program in which I learned the practical details of deep learning applications with hands-on model building using PyTorch and fast.ai and worked on problems ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.<br><br>

After finishing this course, I am able to:<br><br>

apply transfer learning to image classification problems<br>
use neural networks for recommendation algorithms<br>
use recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks for text classification problems<br>
apply neural networks to tabular data and learn embeddings for categorical variables<br><br>

Part 2 tackles more complex problems that require integrating several techniques. This includes both integrating multiple deep learning techniques, as well as combining classic machine learning techniques with deep learning. All methods will be introduced in the context of solving end-to-end real-world modeling problems.<br><br>

We reimplemented the fast.ai library from scratch, allowing me to have a full understanding of DL.

I learned the skills you need to build iPhone apps and submit them to the app store. I developed an understanding of object-oriented programming with Swift, Apple’s new programming language, and learn the best practices for iOS interface design.<br><br>

User Experience Design<br><br>

This course was an introduction to User Experience with a focus on Information Architecture. I created a complete UX brief, from ideation to annotated wireframes that could be handed off to a developer to be built. We also learned to conduct the research necessary and create all the supporting documentation required to defend our design decisions. There was a large focus on how to dissect and analyze common design patterns.
